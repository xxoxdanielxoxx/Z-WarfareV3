	add: Medkit script
	chg: Health script modification
	Medkit is now implemented, health script added to player controller.
	IMPORTANT
	Medkit pickup destroys itself upon pickup, probably going to need to be changed. Medkit heal action
	just turns off the gun because I was thinking it would just play a "healing health kit" animation and
	wouldn't need a health kit model "childed" to the player controller.

	No changes.

	add: Fuckin' tons, yo
	add: Weapon prefabs and Weapon Pickup prefabs
	add: AmmoManager script, holds ammo for gun
	chg: Gun script is now named GunProperties script
	chg: GunProperties, now reloads gun
	chg: WeaponManager, now manages guns in a way that doesn't suck
	chg: All scenes are now at a more updated version (I think)
	chg: Player controller prefab now instantiates weapons instead of just turning on and off gameobjects
	chg: No more BulletSocket/GunPrefab nonsense in the inspector! Seriously, why did I do that.
	##### IMPORTANT NOTES ###########################################
	Gun script has been renamed to GunProperties. There is a deactivated Player Controller prefab that
	Josh was probably using to tune the size of the player in the scene, and it says that referenced
	scripts are missing: that's due to the script name change.
	
	CollisionDetection mode for weapon pickups has been changed to continuous. Unity Manual says that 
	continuous detection causes more of a performance hit, but it is possible for the weapon to fall 
	through the ground if it falls from a high enough height when set to discrete.

	WeaponManager's enum Slot has been changed, so the SetRemoteWeaponSwitch() will probably be broken
	on one of George's scripts.

	Weapon Pickup destroys itself once picked up off the ground or when all of the ammo has been
	taken off of it. It occurs by invoking GunPickupTaken() on GunProperties. George will probably 
	want that altered for his networking code.

	WeaponSpawner destroys itself if it is only supposed to spawn a gun once. Not sure if this funcionality
	will even be needed for final game, but George will probably want it altered for networking code.
