Daily Log
10/02/14
	chg: Refactored scripts, increased some readability
	chg: Unfortnuately had to mess with Philip's Zombie scripts again, ZombieThreatRecognition
	Had problems with bullets having a collider: player would sometimes collide with bullet, causing erratic movement.
	Changed ZombieThreatRecognition to have a public function that bullet would run upon colliding with a zombie
	Bullet script still a bit of a mess, will have TODO: make bullet collide with environment instead of phasing through everything

09/29/14
	add: DistrictProperties, DistrictManager, new tags, new district blocker in scene
	chg: The soldier in level02 with animation is tagged Player and has DistrictProperties added to test DistrictManager
	chg: Messed with ZombieAI and Spawner scripts. Added comments where new code was added, also refer to Asana>District Logic.	
	chg: Changed Hide Mouse bind to F1, and commented out Start() behavior. The hide mouse commands do not play well with Start(). In addition, Esc does not play well with script because Esc is also Unity's "Escape Game Window" button.
	chg: Zombie prefabs now have DistrictProperties script added.
	Proof-of-concept district colliders are in scene, double buildings signify district boundaries.
	Players and zombies walking through districts will cause their DistrictProperties.m_district to change.
	Get to wave 3 to remove blocker to get to district three.
	Look at GameManager and see timer tick down for item drop. The two players in scene are the player and the animated soldier. Moving to district 2 or 3 will pause the timer, since not every player is in the same district.
	

09/26/14
	chg: Changed script where temporary variables were erroneously declared with "m_" notation, turned on ItemSpawner objects in scene.
	

09/24/14 
	chg: Changed private m_fSoundRadius var to public.
	Green wireframe sphere in scene view represents m_fSoundRadius, the distance that firing a gun will alert a zombie.

09/24/14 
	add: Added ThreatEmitter script. Tells zombies when a sound has been made. Added a function SoundDetected() to Philip's ZombieThreatRecognition script.

09/17/14 
	chg: Fixed an error case where the GetAmmo() function from the WeaponManager script would be called on a medkit, due to the PickupLayer logic. Now checks to make sure there is a GunProperties component on object.

09/13/14
	No changes.

09/11/14
	No changes.

09/10/14
	No changes.

09/09/14
	add: Medkit script
	chg: Health script modification
	Medkit is now implemented, health script added to player controller.
	IMPORTANT
	Medkit pickup destroys itself upon pickup, probably going to need to be changed. Medkit heal action
	just turns off the gun because I was thinking it would just play a "healing health kit" animation and
	wouldn't need a health kit model "childed" to the player controller.

09/08/14
	No changes.

09/07/14 
	No changes.

09/06/14
	No changes.

09/05/14	
	add: My Daily Log.txt
	add: Fuckin' tons, yo
	add: Weapon prefabs and Weapon Pickup prefabs
	add: AmmoManager script, holds ammo for gun
	chg: Gun script is now named GunProperties script
	chg: GunProperties, now reloads gun
	chg: WeaponManager, now manages guns in a way that doesn't suck
	chg: All scenes are now at a more updated version (I think)
	chg: Player controller prefab now instantiates weapons instead of just turning on and off gameobjects
	chg: No more BulletSocket/GunPrefab nonsense in the inspector! Seriously, why did I do that.
	##### IMPORTANT NOTES ###########################################
	Gun script has been renamed to GunProperties. There is a deactivated Player Controller prefab that
	Josh was probably using to tune the size of the player in the scene, and it says that referenced
	scripts are missing: that's due to the script name change.
	
	CollisionDetection mode for weapon pickups has been changed to continuous. Unity Manual says that 
	continuous detection causes more of a performance hit, but it is possible for the weapon to fall 
	through the ground if it falls from a high enough height when set to discrete.

	WeaponManager's enum Slot has been changed, so the SetRemoteWeaponSwitch() will probably be broken
	on one of George's scripts.

	Weapon Pickup destroys itself once picked up off the ground or when all of the ammo has been
	taken off of it. It occurs by invoking GunPickupTaken() on GunProperties. George will probably 
	want that altered for his networking code.

	WeaponSpawner destroys itself if it is only supposed to spawn a gun once. Not sure if this funcionality
	will even be needed for final game, but George will probably want it altered for networking code.
