Checked current progress of the project, seems to be in order. Need everyone to start doing daily pushes so I'll have an e mail sent out later to those that aren't.

Created repo, fixed project since it wouldn't let me add files in source tree. There were 2 git folders, one from an old repo. Pushed project and added everyone as a collaborator.
