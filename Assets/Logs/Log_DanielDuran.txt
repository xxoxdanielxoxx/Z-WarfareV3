Pulled and merged new branc and made sure it at least opened...didn't really see if it runs. It looks fine though.

Checked current progress of the project, seems to be in order. Need everyone to start doing daily pushes so I'll have an e mail sent out later to those that aren't.

Created repo, fixed project since it wouldn't let me add files in source tree. There were 2 git folders, one from an old repo. Pushed project and added everyone as a collaborator.
